# Sentify Challenge

This is a sample project for Sentify. The challenge is to automate the creation of an encrypted S3 bucket using the AWS CDK, written in TypeScript.

# Status

Code written to set up an encrypted S3 bucket, not yet tested. Next step: write a fine-grained assertion test.

## Useful commands

* `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
* `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
* `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
* `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute this app.
