# Sentify Challenge

This is a sample project for Sentify. The challenge is to automate the creation of an encrypted S3 bucket using the AWS CDK, written in TypeScript.

# Status

Code written to set up an encrypted S3 bucket, including one fine-grained test. The test is failing because the encryption is not properly set up. Next step: add an encryption key.

## Useful commands

* Compile the TypeScript to JavaScript with `npm run build`
* Run the unit tests (Jest) with `npm test`
